Open reimplementation of Ingenic's closed TX-ISP kernel driver (`tx-isp-<soc>.ko`) for
T10, T20, T21, T23, T30, T31, T40 and T41. The goal is behavioural equivalence with the
OEM driver: same ioctl and `libimp` ABI, same register sequencing, same image behaviour,
with cleaner unload/reload, checked inputs and less memory.

It works with Ingenic's unmodified `libimp.so` and with the open replacement
[OpenIMP](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp). Open stack = open-tx-isp + OpenIMP + a streamer
([timps](https://github.com/Lu-Fi/timps)). The `aperto` branch carries the released open stack on top of the original `main` line; see
[Branches and releases](#branches-and-releases).

This is a reverse-engineering and compatibility effort, not a greenfield pipeline: OEM binary
analysis, `libimp` ABI work and recovery of tuning data.

## Status

State on `aperto` (2026-10-04). "Fully open" = open driver, OpenIMP and streamer run from a flashed image.

| SoC | Status |
|---|---|
| T10 | Fully open; day/night, reload (5 cycles) and boot guard verified. Image controls partly documented. Module 731 KB. |
| T20 | Fully open; 1 h 44 min soak without errors, 10x stop/start and reload without an oops, `rmmod` during streaming refused. Module 736 KB. |
| T21 | First open bring-up, now fully open; AE/ADR/defog/AWB lifted from the vendor module. Module 452 KB (vendor 616). |
| T23 | Fully open (native encoder in OpenIMP); module 622 KB (vendor 857); vendor AE default. Frequent Helix frame drops fixed (residual interrupt, kernel patch merged upstream); still open: a rare single Helix encode error (errno 5), no real WDR. |
| T30 | Builds against a real T30 kernel; earlier bring-up on hardware. Not exercised in the latest campaign. |
| T31 | Reference SoC; SC2336, GC2053, SC301IOT; 2 h 53 min soak without errors; module 711 KB (vendor 829). |
| T40 | Device-tested earlier (T40XP/GC4653); statistics restart stability is a known limitation. Not in the latest campaign. |
| T41 | Fully open from a flashed image (H.264, H.265); reload verified (10/10); module 80 KB smaller than before. Open: flip, night column noise. |

Per feature and SoC:
[FEATURE_MATRIX](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp/blob/aperto/docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md).
History: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Better than the vendor driver

- Reload and stop: 10 stop/start and rmmod/insmod cycles without an oops on T20/T21/T23/T31/T41 (T10: 5 cycles).
- T20/T10 give back about 8 MB RAM (unused 8 MiB V4L2 frame pool off by default); on a T20 the open stack measured 10.5 % streamer CPU against 25.2 % with the vendor stack, snapshots 0.20 s against 0.45 s.
- Smaller modules than the vendor on T21, T23 and T31.
- Checked inputs (all user copies, QBUF window, bounded waits), sensor module pinned while streaming.
- T21 controls and noise reduction act (the vendor ignores them), T10/T20 noise-reduction strength acts.
- Shortfall logging with a concrete parameter value when reserved memory is too small.

Details and streamer integration notes:
[OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp/blob/aperto/docs/OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md).

## Build

Out-of-tree kernel modules, built against a Thingino buildroot output (toolchain and vendor
kernel tree, Linux 3.10.14 for T10-T31, 4.4.94 for T40/T41). The helper picks the SoC with `SOC`:

```sh
SOC=t31 ./build_local.sh          # t10 t20 t21 t23 t30 t31 t40 t41
TH=/path/to/thingino-firmware SOC=t23 ./build_local.sh
```

`TH`, `ROOT`, `KDIR`, `CROSS` and `ARCH` can be overridden (see the comments in `build_local.sh`).
It builds `driver/<soc>/` into `tx-isp-<soc>.ko` plus the diagnostic `driver/tx_isp_trace.ko`; when no
module for the SoC was built locally the result is a compile baseline only. The T20 driver expects the
`external/ingenic-sdk` submodule (`git submodule update --init`). Host tests for kernel-independent
primitives: `make -C tests check`.

## Integration in Thingino

The packages `open-tx-isp` (this driver) and `openimp` (userspace) are in the upstream
[thingino-firmware](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware) branch `aperto`
([#1756](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1756)), selected with
`BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_ISP_OPEN` (menu "ISP stack") and pinned by commit SHA to the `aperto` branches
of the opensensor repositories. The module is installed as `tx-isp-<soc>.ko` and replaces the proprietary one;
SDK sensor, audio and AVPU modules stay. The kernel VPU/rmem stability patches
([#1748](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1748),
[#1752](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1752)) are merged there. The optional
boot guard `BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_ISP_GUARD` ([#1749](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1749),
default off; `isp_open=auto|manual|off`) skips the ISP/sensor modules after an unstable load so a bad
driver cannot boot-loop the camera. Once the first date tag exists on `aperto`, thingino's `aperto` branch will pin that tag instead of a SHA.

## Branches and releases

- `main`: the original author's line (opensensor). It is left untouched and is a strict ancestor of `aperto`.
- `aperto`: the open stack release line: OpenIMP + open-tx-isp, as used by the thingino `aperto` branch. Fast-forward only; every commit was flashed and checked on cameras. Releases are tagged `vYYYY.MM.DD` on this branch, and thingino pins a tag instead of a SHA.
- Development and the device-test campaign happen in the [Lu-Fi forks](https://github.com/Lu-Fi/open-tx-isp) (branch `next` = integration, `claude/<topic>` = topic branches); tested work reaches `aperto` from `next` after a clean soak.
- Companion repository: [opensensor/openimp](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp) (branch `aperto`). Both repositories are released together; use matching tags.

## Reporting problems

Open an issue at [opensensor/open-tx-isp](https://github.com/opensensor/open-tx-isp/issues) (kernel driver, ISP, memory) or [opensensor/openimp](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp/issues) when unsure. Please include the SoC and sensor, the revisions of open-tx-isp, OpenIMP and the streamer, `dmesg` (including any shortfall line such as `set ispmem >= N KB`), the streamer log, the stream set and the `rmem`/`ispmem` values. Do not post addresses, credentials or location names. Details: [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp/wiki/Troubleshooting#reporting-a-problem).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome when grounded in OEM binary analysis, `libimp` ABI validation, hardware
logs or captures, tuning/calibration recovery or documentation. For behavioural changes state the OEM
evidence, the files changed, how it was validated and what remains uncertain.
